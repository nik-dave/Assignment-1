### Assignment Description for Internship Position

**Objective**: Develop a MATLAB application that processes data from a CSV file, generates a plot based on this data, and outputs the results to a file. Set up a GitHub repository to manage your code with GitHub Actions configured to automatically execute a suite of unit tests whenever updates are pushed.

**Overview**:
We are seeking an intern who can demonstrate proficiency in MATLAB, an understanding of GitHub for version control, and the ability to integrate GitHub Actions for continuous integration. This assignment will test your skills in these areas and provide a practical insight into your problem-solving abilities and coding practices.

**Assignment Details**:

1. **MATLAB Application Requirements**:
   - Develop a MATLAB script that reads data from a provided CSV file.
   - Implement functionality to generate a plot based on the data.
   - Include robust error handling to manage potential issues with input data (e.g., missing values, incorrect data types).
   - Output the plot results to a file.

2. **GitHub Repository Setup**:
   - Make the repository to your GitHub account.
   - Ensure your repository is public to allow review of your code.
   - Structure your code with clear, logical organisation and include a `README.md` file documenting:
     - How to set up and run your application.
     - Any dependencies or external libraries used.
     - A brief description of the functionality.

3. **Testing and Continuous Integration**:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for your MATLAB application to verify functionality and robustness.
   - Configure GitHub Actions within your repository to automatically run these tests whenever new commits are pushed to the repository.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Include detailed comments within your MATLAB script to explain the purpose and logic of your code.
   - Use clear and informative commit messages to document your development process.

**Submission Instructions**:
   - Complete your assignment within the GitHub repository.
   - Once completed, email the link to your GitHub repository to georg.wilding@asml.com and nik.dave@asml.com.
   - Ensure that all commits are pushed to your GitHub repository by the submission deadline.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Code quality and readability.
   - Implementation of specified functionality.
   - Effectiveness and coverage of unit tests.
   - Successful setup and configuration of GitHub Actions.
   - Clarity and thoroughness of documentation.

**Deadline**:
   - All submissions must be received in less than two weeks.

**Feedback**:
   - Feedback will be provided within two weeks after the submission deadline.
